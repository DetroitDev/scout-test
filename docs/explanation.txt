I spent some more time working on the nginx.conf and my custom configurations in the conf.d directory
but I am still having trouble getting it exactly right. I feel like I'm pretty close but just need
some more time or someone to get me pointed in the right direction since this is my first time
trying to set up nginx.

Anyhow in an effort to demonstrate that I am not totally inept I have set up another server running
a LAMP stack. I actually purchase a VPS to set this up on but they're telling me 24-48 hours before
it's provisioned. So I'm reluctantly running this on one of my dev servers at work.

Magento Deployment -

    I ran the Magento installer with default configurations

    System > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods
            Enable COD
            Disable Saved CC
            Disable Check/Money Order

    Enabled Form Key Validation to clear initial system warning
    Re-index Magento to clear initial system warning
    Clear all caches

AOE Sheduler Module Installation -

    I installed the https://github.com/AOEpeople/Aoe_Scheduler module via FTP (NOTE: I see in the
    documentation that they are talking about doing this with Composer. I have plenty of experience
    using composer with M2 but not M1. I will certainly be reading up on this)

    Compilation is already disabled in the admin

    Flushed all Caches

    Log out/log back in

    Check System > Advanced > Disable Modules Output to confirm the module has been successfully installed
    and is enabled

    I did not find any clear direction on configurations for this module in the documentation (see
    following link). A lot of the documentation looks to be a work in progress. I did however confirm that a lot of new options
    have been added under System > Configuration > Advanced > System > Cron (Scheduled Tasks)
    https://github.com/AOEpeople/Aoe_Scheduler/blob/master/doc/cron-configuration.md is pretty vague
    with just a brief link to the dev-docs on generic crontab creation.

Create Test Category -

    Under Catalog > Manage Categories I created a new sub category of the default category called
    Shirts.

    General Information Tab -
        Set Is Active to Yes, entered Lorem Ipsum for the description, uploaded a sample image,
        entered a page title and set Include In Navigation Menu to Yes.

    Display Settings Tab -
        I left Display Mode set to Products only so not using any static blocks here.
        Set Is Anchor to Yes
        All other options are using the default configuration settings

    No changes to Custom Design and Category Products tabs -

Create Test Product -

    Under Catalog > Manage Products I created a new product called Dummy T Shirt

    General Tab -
        Added Lorem Ipsum to Description and Short Description
        Set SKU to DUMMY
        Set Weight to 1
        Set Status to Enabled
        Set Visibility to Catalog Search

    Prices Tab -
        Set the price to $50
        Set Tax Class to Taxable Goods

    Images Tab -
        Uploaded a sample image and set to Base Image, Small Image and Thumbnail

    Inventory Tab -
        Set QTY to 9999
        Set Stock Availability to In Stock

    Categories Tab -
        Selected newly created Shirts category that was configured in the last step
