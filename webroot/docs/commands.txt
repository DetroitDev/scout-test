Note: I was asked to set up this server with Digital Ocean.
I did not see an option to deploy RHEL, so I am running CentOS 7.

Credentials -
SSH
165.227.194.203
jason
Scout241!
DB
jason
Scout241

Create User -
adduser jason
passwd jason (Password is Scout241!)

Add user to wheel group:
gpasswd -a jason wheel

Normally I would set up an SSH key and disable SSH login for the root user

 yum install epel-release
 yum install nginx
 systemctl start nginx

Running into an issue here with http://scout-test.com/index.php/install/ returning a 404
after the download process. It looks like I need to configure NGINX to understand .htaccess
I ran out of time. I will get an M1 instance up and running to finish the remaining tasks
in this assignment and submit ASAP.
